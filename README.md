- Counter Strike 2

- This method has not yet been defined. I checked my account and I still haven't received a VAC ban. If you update the offsets and add additional features, you can even make this system pay-by-cheat (P2C). I was expecting it to be detected by MinHook CS2, but it is not. Valve Anti Cheat is so stupid.
